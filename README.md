# Team-Web-Programming-Project
My local copy of the first and second part of my second year team project module

The task was to create an online ticketing system for a fictional company.

The system was to be able to handle multiple logins with differring levels of access, adding new tickets, viewing, completing and deleting existing tickets and even searching for tickets.

Logins were to be handled by a cookie-like system (using php sessions).
